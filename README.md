#LegitCal

First of all, I'd like to clarify that this project is totally about play with front end design. There's nothing really about "reinventing calculating" or any of the big word used in the page when initialized.  

LegitCal is just a simple calculator. :p  

Also, this is still in progress!  

##Reason I made LegitCal

Three days ago (Feb. 2nd, 2017), I found a calculator I made using HTML, JS, and CSS as I was looking through my old files. This calculator was named "webCal" and last edited on "October 26, 2016 at 10:03 PM". Seeing how much I have progressed, I decided to remake another calculator as a learning experience and a practice of front end developing (thus the exquisite words on the description).  
I remember that webCal was all copied and pasted from online (in order to learn), and I am sure it took me at least a week to grasp what I was exactly doing. Now, however, I was able to make LegitCal all from scratch.  
If you look at the images folder, you'll see what webCal look like and how it contrasts from legitCal. :)
